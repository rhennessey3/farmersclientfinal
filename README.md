## About
We started the Farmers Bazaar for people living during the pandemic .For the immunocompromised it's difficult to get fresh produce from local farms with exposing risk of exposure. We wanted to give people a way to not feel panicked and anxious every time they wanted to go out to the farmers market.

### Goal                                          
Create a way to connect farmers to local shoppers looking for produce                       

### Solution                                         
This app allows farmers to upload inventory and connect that inventory to local shoppers                                    

### Result                                        

Less exposure risk for both farmers and shoppers to access farm fresh vegitables
